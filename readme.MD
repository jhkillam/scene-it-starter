# Scene It

## About
The intention of this website was to learn about using APIs and promises to search for movies, then let the user add their preference to a watch list using localStorage in the browser. This uses the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) for searching for movies.

## Wishlist Items
If I had more time to work on this, I would like to add: 

* A function to check if a movie is already on the watchlist
* A button to remove movies from the watchlist
* Pagination to see more than the first 10 results from the API call
* Better styling
* Solution for movies that do not have a poster/image
